# Dimensium Base

[Dimensium Base] serves as the foundation for all Dimensium projects. It is responsible for providing code infrastructure like a thread safe synchronous logging system, fast reading and writing of world dimension files, and interoperability with [RocksDB].

These docs contains:

- A code walkthrough, which will makes new contributors easier to explore the bunch of code;
- API reference for contributors who read the code walkthrough.
